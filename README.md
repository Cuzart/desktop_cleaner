## Getting started

1.  **Prerequisites**

    Before you start, you should have Python 3 with Pip installed.

    Then set up a virtual environment and install the required packages inside the project.

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Configure your paths**

    Now you can configure your source and destination path in a _.env_ file. There is a .env.example file, that you can rename and use.

    ```shell
    SOURCE_DIR=/Users/youruser/Desktop
    DESTINATION_DIR=/Users/youruser/Documents
    ```

    You can also change the logic on how to determine different paths for each file
    in the _get_destination_ function in _functions.py_.

3.  **Start the script.**

    You can start the script manually or set up a cron job to do so.

    ```shell
    python main.py
    ```
